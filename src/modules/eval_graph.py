# TODO
# - take the sampled graph
# - sum the probability for each word pair over all rule labels!
#   (they are mutually exclusive, so we can sum)
# - sort the resulting edges
# - compare to gold standard edges
#   - produce a list: word_1 word_2 prob gs_prob (0 or 1)
# - display a table of results with various thresholds
